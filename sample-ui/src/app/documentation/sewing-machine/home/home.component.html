<h1>What is the Sewing Machine?</h1>
<p>
    Before using the Sewing Machine, we should understand what it is exactly and where it fits into an application's
    architecture.
</p>
<h4 class="orange">
    The Sewing Machine stitches together the Application Fabric using the Bifr√∂st as the thread.

<h3>
    Sewing Machine is an <strong class="emphasis">intent compiler</strong>
</h3>

<p>
    Traditionally compilers translate a language into machine code, a transpiler translates code from one language to another. What is all this 'intent' compiler then?
</p>
<p>
    The compiler works by taking user intentions and compiling them into  applications, services, components and operations. The sewing machine can <strong class="emphasis">automatically build the lions share of your
    application's data and infrastructure architecture</strong>. It does this by employing some strict architectural principals and opinionated tooling, but in a universal and technology
    independent way.
</p>
<h3>
    What are you talking about?
</h3>

<p>
    Let's take a typical example of a what an engineer needs to do when asked to build a new product that requires customer experience/interactivity:
</p>
<hr/>
<ol class="list">
    <li>Run the gauntlet of researching the latest technology shift in UI technologies </li>
    <li>Ensure choices are compatible with existing stack & existing product(s)</li>
    <li>Map out backend APIs required to meet UX demands</li>
    <li>Negotiate API contract specifications with backend (if at all)</li>
    <li>Design middleware to support APISs that cannot be managed or consumed directly</li>
    <li>Map out UI business logic required to support APIs</li>
    <li>Map out middleware business logic required to support orchestration / persistence</li>
    <li>Map out UI & middleware architecture and technology testing (e2e & unit)</li>
    <li>Map out non RESTful standards into middleware (pub-sub/gRPC/graphQL etc)</li>
    <li>Build out UI and middleware foundations</li>
    <li>Build out UI and middleware business logic against shifting API contracts.. and maintain as it shifts.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>
    Once all that is done, then you can start to build a new product. This process can take months and of engineers time.
</p>

<h3>The sewing machine will do all of the above for you in seconds.</h3>
<p> Not only will it build out every single line of business logic, models and interfaces for your APIs, it will also build your '<strong class="emphasis">ready-to-modify</strong>' UI components.</p>
