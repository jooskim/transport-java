<h1>Creating a distributed bus across iFrames</h1>

<p>
  The bus has the capability to connect up event bus instances running inside child applications. This allows a third party application that is also using the Bifr√∂st, to connect
  to the parent / master event bus. This allows the child application to talk to services in the parent UI, or even open connections to brokers and tap directly into live streams.
</p>

<p>
  You have the ability to control which origins are allowed to join the distributed bus, also which channels are authorized to be exposed across the distributed bus. This ensures that
  channels can be restricted across applications. You can also configure which iFrames are authorized to allow the bus instances to be connected.

<p>
  When you want to enable this feature (it's called the bus proxy). You can enable it with <code class="clr-code">this.bus.enableMessageProxy(config: MessageProxyConfig): ProxyControl;</code> method.
  The <code class="clr-code">MessageProxyConfig</code> object defines the channels, origins and iframes authorized to use the proxy.
