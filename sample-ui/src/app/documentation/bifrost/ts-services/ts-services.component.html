<h1>Building Services</h1>
<p>
    There are two ways to create services. The first is manually (which is what we're going to do next). The second is
    via auto-generation using the SewingMachine.
</p>
<p>
    A core philosophy of the application fabric, is that business logic and boilerplate code that operates with API's and infrastructure,
    should be un-managed, autogenerated code that is created from strongly defined specifications. Building services manually
    may make sense for your use case, <span class="emphasis">But it isn't required</span>.
</p>

<p>
    To get started, we should create a new class called <code
    class="clr-code">PongService</code> in a folder named <code class="clr-code">services</code>
    that sits off the root of your <code class="clr-code">src/</code> folder. Your path should be <code
    class="clr-code">~/my-app-folder/src/services</code>
</p>
<p>
    The first thing we need to do in order to create our first simple <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> is
    create a <code class="clr-code">PongServiceRequest</code> model and a
    <code class="clr-code">PongServiceResponse</code> model. These two models are responsible for allowing other actors
    to know what to send to our service, and what to expect in response.
</p>
<p>
    In the <code class="clr-code">services/</code> folder, we will create a new file called <code class="clr-code">pong.service.model.ts</code>.
    This is our request/response model that defines
    what our <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> listens for and responds with.
</p>

<h3>Create Service Request/Response Models.</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>import &#123; ChannelName &#125; from '@vmw/bifrost';

export const PongServiceChannel: ChannelName = 'services::PongService';

export enum PongRequestType &#123;
    Basic,
    Full
&#125;

export interface PongServiceRequest &#123;
    command: PongRequestType;
    message: string;
&#125;

export interface PongServiceResponse &#123;
    value: string;
&#125;</code></pre>

<p>
    Pretty simple right? We have defined a channel on which to talk, an enum to define the command we want to send and
    then two simple interfaces that define request and responses.
    You're not restricted to interfaces here, you can also use classes. The important thing to remember here is that
    this is <strong>*ALL*</strong> that is required in order to
    talk to our new <code class="clr-code">PongService</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Next, lets create our actual <code class="clr-code">PongService</code>. It looks like this:
</p>

<h3>PongService</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>import &#123; AbstractService &#125; from '@vmw/bifrost/core';
import &#123; EventBus, MessageArgs &#125; from '@vmw/bifrost';
import &#123;
    PongRequestType,
    PongServiceChannel,
    PongServiceRequest,
    PongServiceResponse
&#125; from './pong.service.model';

export class PongService extends AbstractService&lt;PongServiceRequest, PongServiceResponse&gt; &#123;

    constructor() &#123;

        // identify the name of this service, and the channel it operates on.
        super('PongService', PongServiceChannel);

        // log that the service is online (if logging enabled)
        this.log.info('PongService Loaded');
    &#125;

    /**
     * Handle a request send on the service channel.
     * @param request the request object
     * @param args automatically passed by superclass, important details within.
     */
    protected handleServiceRequest(request: PongServiceRequest, args?: MessageArgs): void &#123;

        switch (request.command) &#123;
            case PongRequestType.Basic:
                this.handleBasicRequest(request.message, args);
                break;

            case PongRequestType.Full:
                this.handleFullRequest(request.message, args);
        &#125;
    &#125;

    /**
     * Handle a basic request (limited details)
     * @param message this is the message sent by the requesting actor.
     * @param args these are important values that identify who sent the request.
     */
    private handleBasicRequest(message: string, args: MessageArgs): void &#123;

        const basicResponse = &#123;
            value: `pong '$&#123;message&#125;'`
        &#125;;

        // send a response to whomever requested it.
        this.postResponse(PongServiceChannel, basicResponse, args);
    &#125;

    /**
     * Handle a more detailed response (more details)
     * @param message this is the message sent by the requesting actor.
     * @param args these are important values that identify who sent the request.
     */
    private handleFullRequest(message: string, args: MessageArgs): void &#123;

        // get a timestamp.
        const date = new Date();
        const dateString = date.toLocaleDateString('en-US');
        const perf = performance.now();

        const basicResponse = &#123;
            value: `pong '$&#123;message&#125;' (on $&#123;date&#125; by event bus with id $&#123;EventBus.id&#125;) time: $&#123;perf&#125;`
        &#125;;

        // send a response to whomever requested it.
        this.postResponse(PongServiceChannel, basicResponse, args);

    &#125;
&#125;</code></pre>
<p>
    Now we can load <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> whenever we like.
</p>

<h3 id="loadingservice">Loading Services</h3>

<p>
    To load a service you can use the in-built static <code class="clr-code">ServiceLoader</code>
    utility. The <code class="clr-code">ServiceLoader</code> takes the service class type as the first argument, and
    then as many other constructor properties as you need for your service (variable args). In this example, we could load our
    service at the same time we boot the bus (i.e. before Angular even loads).
</p>
<p>
    We could also load the service on demand when it's required, by loading the service as a part of a module definition.
    It's really up to you. The general rule is that a global service, should be ready before your application boots, other services can be booted on demand.
</p>
<p>
    How do I boot <code class="clr-code">PongService</code>? Easy. Just pass your class to <code class="clr-code">ServiceLoader</code>.
    Just like this:
</p>

<h3>Using ServiceLoader</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>import &#123; ServiceLoader &#125; from '@vmw/bifrost/util/service.loader';

ServiceLoader.addService(PongService);</code></pre>

<p>
    If you want to create a service that accepts constructor arguments, and you want to pass them to the service loader? You can just add your constructor args
    to the  <code class="clr-code">AddService</code> method.
</p>

<h3>Using ServiceLoader with constructor args</h3>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
    constructor(arg1, arg2, arg3) &#123;
...

ServiceLoader.addService(PongService, arg1, arg2, arg3);</code></pre>

<p>
    Once the service has loaded, you should see some output in the developer console, that looks something like...
</p>
<pre>‚ñ´Ô∏èÔ∏è<span class="console-purple">[Inf]:</span> üåé <span class="console-pink">Service Adaptor: PongService (3e4f3014) online and listening on 'services::PongService'</span> <span class="console-who">[PongService]</span> <span class="console-time">(9:25:39 AM)</span>
‚ñ´Ô∏èÔ∏è<span class="console-purple">[Inf]:</span> <span class="console-pink">PongService Loaded</span>
</pre>
