<h1>
    Sewing Machine Quickstart
</h1>

<p>
    The quickest way to get started with the Sewing Machine is to use <strong class="emphasis">App-o-matic</strong> to
    build an
    entire, ready to run application, that uses a sample API contract. This sample API runs on this site, so you can try
    it all out yourself
    for real.

            <span class="alert-text">
                ðŸ‘‰ You will <strong>need to have Docker installed</strong> in order to build the SewingMachine ðŸ‘ˆ

<h2>Step 1: Grab the SewingMachine toolchain</h2>

<p>
    Don't worry, you don't need to mount anything or set up a bunch of environmental variables, all you need to do is
    pull down our simple build script that will handle everything for you.
</p>

<h4>Create a new folder called 'fabric-tools'</h4>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; mkdir ~/fabric-tools && cd ~/fabric-tools</code></pre>

<h4>Grab the Sewing Machine build script</h4>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; wget http://appfabric.vmware.com/assets/build-sewingmachine.sh -O build-sewingmachine.sh</code></pre>

<h4>Make the script executable</h4>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; chmod +x build-sewingmachine.sh</code></pre>


<hr/>


<h2>Step 2: Build all the things</h2>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; ./build-sewingmachine.sh latest</code></pre>

<p>
    You can use latest or the version (v2.xxx)
</p>

<p>You will see docker complaining about not finding local images of the sewing-machine and will then proceed to download the latest Docker image
that actually compiles all our of tooling. Your console will output something like the below (along with a bunch of Docker output)</p>

<pre><span class="console-blue">Building apigen for darwin amd64...
Building servgen2 for darwin amd64...
Building linty for darwin amd64...
Building modelgen for darwin amd64...
Building appgen for darwin amd64...
Building appgen2 for darwin amd64...
Building specgen for darwin amd64...
Building appomatic for darwin amd64...</span></pre>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <div class="alert-items">
        <div class="alert-item static">
            <span class="alert-text">
                If you're on a mac, you will see darwin amd64, if you're running another OS with a different proc type, you will see something different.
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Step 3: Download our sample API Specification</h2>

<p>
    In order to create a useful application, you need some APIs to call right? You can use our sample OpenAPI specification
    as a sample to get going. You can download it in the same way you downloaded the build script.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; wget http://appfabric.vmware.com/assets/fabric-sample-services-api-doc.yaml -O fabric-sample-services-api-doc.yaml</code></pre>


<h2>Step 4: Build your sample app!</h2>

<p>
    Now you have the tooling and a valid API contract for a 'service'. Now you're ready to build. We're going to call our app 'sample-app'
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; ./appomatic --new -dvt --alias=@sample-app --add-YAML=fabric-sample-services-api-doc.yaml --autogen ~/sample-app</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <div class="alert-items">
        <div class="alert-item static">
            <span class="alert-text">
               We have added the --dvt flag here, this will print out verbose, debug and trace level output, so you can see what is going on. There should be
                a number of messages generated by the sewing machine.
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<hr/>
<h2>Step 5: Run your sample App!</h2>

<p>
   Once your sample app has been built, you can run it!
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-shell" ngNonBindable>&gt; cd ~/sample-app && npm start</code></pre>

<p>
    Your brand new, ready to go (but empty) app should boot and you should be able to load it  up in a browser on <strong class="emphasis">http://localhost:4200</strong>.
