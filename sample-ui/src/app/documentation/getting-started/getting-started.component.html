    The Event Bus and Model store are a part of the Bifröst, which sits between the view and services layer. It's the
    communication layer between services, components and the backend infrastructure. The Bifröst operates across
    the front-end and the backend of your applications. It can also work across extensions of your applications that are
    typically running in iFrames or sandboxed Web Components.
