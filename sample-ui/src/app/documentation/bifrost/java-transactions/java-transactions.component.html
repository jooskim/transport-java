<h1>Using Transactions.</h1>
<p>
    A technique that can be used to encapsulate a conversation between a component and a service, or between
    services themselves - is to use a transaction.
</p>
<p>
    Transactions via the Bifr√∂st are not traditional transactions, in the sense that they can be rolled back if they fail, instead they are defined as a
    group of requests and responses that have to occur before the transaction can be considered complete.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you need to call a number of services to get a number of responses, in order to be able to construct
    a response for a component - this would be a transactions.

</p>
<p>
    Similarly if you need to make a number of calls to services and wait for stores to be available and populated, this would also be a
    transaction. Transactions can be either synchronous, or asynchronous.
</p>
<p>
    Transactions are asynchronous by default. Essentially when you commit transactions, all the requests will be fired
    at once, the transaction will complete once responses to all those requests have been
    completed. These responses can arrive in any order and at any time (hence the asynchronous nature).
</p>
<p>
    However there may be times when you want your logic to run in a synchronous manner
    (due to your API design for example). When running a synchronous transaction, each request in the transaction will
    only fire once the previous one has completed. This is obviously a lot slower,
    but may be required based on your needs.
</p>

<h3>
    How do I create / start a transaction?
</h3>

<p>
    <code class="clr-code">this.bus.createTransaction()</code> is the simplest way to create any transaction. You will be returned a <code class="clr-code">Transaction</code>
    object, which allows you to track progress of the transaction and more.
</p>

<h3>
    What types of transactions are there available?
</h3>

<p>
    There are two types of transactions available.
</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li><code class="clr-code">Asynchronous</code> - <span class="emphasis">All requests fired at once, no way to determine which response comes back in which order.</span></li>
    <li><code class="clr-code">Synchronous</code> - <span class="emphasis">Each request is fired only after the previous request has returned.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>
    If don't care about which order your responses come back in, then <code class="clr-code">Asynchronous</code> is what you're looking for. If you need all your
    responses to be returned in sequence, ensuring a stepped one-at-a-time process, then <code class="clr-code">Synchronous</code> is what you need. <code class="clr-code">Asynchronous</code> transactions are <strong class="emphasis">MUCH FASTER</strong>
</p>


<h3>
    What happens if something goes wrong mid-transaction?
</h3>

<p>
    Like with every other fabric concept, we have built success and error handlers for every operation. If a service errors out during the transaction,
    then the error handler you supply via <code class="clr-code">transaction.onError()</code> will be triggered. You will receive the error that occurred. The remainder
    of the transaction will be stopped.
</p>

    Below is an example of a Java Consumer that calls <code class="clr-code">PongService</code> and <code class="clr-code">CalendarService</code> via an
    asynchronous transaction

<h3>
    What is happening in this example?
</h3>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
@Component
public class PongCalendarServiceConsumer extends AbstractBase &#123;

    private ScheduledExecutorService executorService;

    PongCalendarServiceConsumer() &#123; this.executorService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5); &#125;

    /**
     * Call PongService and Calendar Service as a part of a transaction
     */
    @Override
    public void initialize() &#123;
        // create task, wait 1 second before executing.
        Runnable runTransactionTask = () -&gt; this.runTransaction();
        executorService.schedule(runTransactionTask, 1000,  TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    &#125;

...</code></pre>

<p>The first thing this example does is create a new scheduled Java Executor, this is so we can push a Runnable lambda that performs
a unit of work, after a certain delay. We do this because this is a working demo, we have to ensure every other service is up before we
can start calling them.</p>

<p>
    One thing we're also doing here is ensuring that all service requests in a transaction, use the same ID for each message
    going across each channel. You can see this in action when we create a <code class="clr-code">UUID</code> that is fed
    into the transaction, and each request going out.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
private void runTransaction() &#123;
    // create async transaction
    UUID transactionId = UUID.randomUUID();
    Transaction transaction = bus.createTransaction(Transaction.TransactionType.ASYNC, transactionId);
...</code></pre>

<p>
    In this next step, we created a new <code class="clr-code">Transaction</code> that is <code class="clr-code">ASYNC</code>. This means
    our transaction will fire every request at the same time and collect responses in any order they arrive.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
// send request to PongService
transaction.sendRequest(
    PongService.Channel,
    new Request&lt;String&gt;(transactionId, "Basic") // request basic pong
);

// send request to CalendarService
transaction.sendRequest(
        CalendarService.Channel,
        new Request&lt;String&gt;(transactionId, "time") // request time
);
...</code></pre>

<p> In the above step, we actually queue up requests to be sent out as a part of the transaction. In this case, there are two requests, once is for t
the <code class="clr-code">CalendarService</code> and the other is for the <code class="clr-code">PongService</code></p>.

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
// when transaction is done
transaction.onComplete(
    (Message[] responses) -&gt; &#123;

        // concatenate service responses into a string.
        StringBuilder serviceResponses = new StringBuilder();
        for(Message msg: responses) &#123;

            String serviceResponse = ClassMapper.CastPayload(String.class, (Response)msg.getPayload());
            serviceResponses.append("&gt; " + serviceResponse + " "); // add each response together.
        &#125;

        // log output.
        this.logInfoMessage("PongCalendarServiceConsumer:", "Response", serviceResponses.toString());
    &#125;
);
...</code></pre>

<p>
    In the above sample, we're defining our success handler for a successfully completed transaction. Your success handler
    will simply be passed an array of <code class="clr-code">Message</code> objects. YOu can then do what you need to with these
    objects, they will be in a random order if the transaction is async, otherwise they will be in the same order your requests were
    queued up in.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>...
 // commit transaction.
transaction.commit();
...</code></pre>

<p>
    The last step is to commit the transaction, this essentially fires everything off. Nothing happens until you commit the transaction. The
    <code class="clr-code">commit()</code> method returns immediately and the transaction begins.
</p>
