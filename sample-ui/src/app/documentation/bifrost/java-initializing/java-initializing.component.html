<h1>Initializing The Bifröst (Java)</h1>

<p>
    The Java version of the Bifröst depends on Spring. This makes it much, much simpler to build your applications using the bus.
</p>

<p>
    There isn't actually anything you need to do to initialize the Bifröst. It's self booting once you import the Jar into your Java Application, and if you're using
    ss-base or ss-backend, it's already there and will self boot.
