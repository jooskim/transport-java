<h1>Understanding 'broadcast' vs 'direct' messaging</h1>

<p>
  The Bifröst is analogous to Slack (for software), except the Bifröst allows direct messages inside a channel, where
  as Slack opens up stand-alone conversations between actors outside of a channel.
  The concept however remains the same. When a component needs to restrict a conversation between its self, and a
  service - we can use a direct message.
</p>
<p>
  When another Class/Service is interested in everything being broadcast by a service, then that actor can simply
  subscribe to the service channel and listen for everything.
</p>

<p>
  The use case for direct messaging between a consumer and service arrives when you need a specific response to be
  delivered to a specific consumer, i.e. you don't want every other listener on that channel
  getting that same response (because we're operating on a single channel). It's like talking in a public chat, vs
  talking in a direct message with that service.

<h3>Sending requests using ID's</h3>

<p>
  There are three ways to conduct direct messaging. The first is to use methods in the
  API that accept an ID. Every API (like request once <code class="clr-code">()</code>)
  has two variations, the first is the same method name that has <code class="clr-code">...withId()</code> appended to
  the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
  The second is <code class="clr-code">...withIdAndVersion()</code>.
  The signature for both is mostly the same, except they obviously take an ID, or an ID and a version. Versions are not
  used yet, however support is coming in future versions of the fabric.
</p>
<p>
  The third is with a <strong class="empahsis">Transaction</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Let's take a look at an example of using one of these methods:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>const request: PongServiceRequest = &#123;
    command: PongRequestType.Basic,
    message: 'basic ping'
&#125;;

this.bus.requestOnceWithId&lt;PongServiceRequest, PongServiceResponse&gt;(
    UUID.randomUUID();,           // message id
    'my-channel',                 // channel on which to send request
    request,                      // payload to be sent on the channe
).handle(
    (response: SomeTypedResponse) =&gt; &#123;
        // do something with this successful request
    &#125;,
    (error: GeneralError) =&gt; &#123;
        // something went wrong, lets handle it.
    &#125;
);</code></pre>

<p>
  The above example will send a request to <code class="clr-code">PongService</code>, but this time, we're sending
  that message with a <strong>Random UUID</strong>. This means that the consumer
  is only going to listen for a response that <strong>also contains that same ID</strong>. Any other response coming
  in over <code class="clr-code">PongServiceChannel</code> that has a different ID, or
  has no ID <strong>will be ignored</strong> by the <code class="clr-code">handle(...)</code> method.
</p>

<h3>Quick note on generating UUID's</h3>
<p>
  Always use a valid UUID. Java makes it really easy. <code class="clr-code">UUID.randomUUID()</code> is all you need.
