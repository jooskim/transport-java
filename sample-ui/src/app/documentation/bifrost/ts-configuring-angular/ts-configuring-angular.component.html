    Configuring Angular
</h1>

<p>
    Angular provides <code class="clr-code">angular.json</code> (for Angular 7+) and <code class="clr-code">angular-cli.json</code>
    (for Angular 4-5).
</p>
<p>
    In this file, there is a section defined as <code class="clr-code">scripts</code>. This section is where you provide
    third party scripts to be booted and loaded by your Angular application.
    Clarity already adds a couple of files to this section in order to operate correctly. You will need to add the
    Bifr√∂st UMD file to this section. It's already been saved in your <code class="clr-code">node_modules</code>
    folder. Just provide an entry like the one below.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<code clr-code-highlight="language-javascript" ngNonBindable>
"scripts": [
    "node_modules/@vmw/bifrost/bifrost.umd.min.js"
]
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Your application is ready!
</p>
