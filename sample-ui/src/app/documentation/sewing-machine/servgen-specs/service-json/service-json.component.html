<h1>Service Adapter Specification</h1>

<h3>Specifications: service.json</h3>

<p>
    By convention, <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> contains the core specification for a Service Adapter. There must exist
    one instance of this specification file (or its content) in order for a Service Adapter to be autogenerated. Consider the following
    minimalist <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> for the <strong class="emphasis">SddcCore</strong> Service Adapter, which
    responds to a single service request, and it does not result in any API calls to a backend service. Because of this lack of dependence
    on a backend service, this Service Adapter is also a <code class="clr-code">Service</code> itself.
    We will augment this specification incrementally to explain each additional property in detail:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>
&#123;
    "name": "sddc-core",
    "version": "1",

    "service_requests": [
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetSddcList",
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc", "container": "array" &#125;
        &#125;
    ]
&#125;

<table class="table table-noborder flag-table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="left flag-header">Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">name</td>
        <td class="flag-value">This property specifies that the name of the Service Adapter is <code class="clr-code">sddc-core</code>.
            The kebab-case for the name is usual for Service Adapters written in Typescript. For those written in Java, the name must
            be in PascalCase, i.e. <code class="clr-code">SddcCore</code>. In either language, the value for
            <strong class="emphasis">name</strong> specified here must match the name of the folder for the Service Adapter. Thus,
            for Typescript, the location of this <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> is
            <strong class="emphasis">.../sddc-core/specs/service.json</strong>, while for Java, it is
            <strong class="emphasis">.../SddcCore/specs/service.json</strong>. In either language, the class autogenerated for
            this Service Adapter will be <strong class="emphasis">SddcCoreService</strong> (to be renamed to
            <strong class="emphasis">SddcCoreServiceAdapter</strong> in future).

        <td class="flag-value">This property specifies the version of the Service Adapter. This is a simple monotonically incrementing

    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">service_response</td>
        <td class="flag-value">All requests to a Service Adapter, <strong class="emphasis">must</strong> have a response,

                service_response</strong> with the
            response from an API call (described below), even when they are the same. A service response may, at times,
            combine the response from multiple API calls into a single response. Also, in the case of
            <code class="clr-code">customized</code> Service Adapters, there is a response even when no API calls are
            invoked.
            <br/><br/>
            To reiterate, a requestor to a Service Adapter only knows about the service request, the input parameters,
            and the service response. The requestor has no knowledge or the ability to access what API calls are
            performed on its behalf, nor the responses from the API calls if any.
            <br/><br/>
            The <code class="clr-code">Service Requests</code> described above, can have a number of optional properties and one mandatory property:
            <code class="clr-code">service_response</code> which describes the object(s) that is the response type for this request.
            In the example above, the requests <code class="clr-code">GetSddcList</code> responds with an array of Sddc objects. Please
            refer to the description of <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code> described in the overview document, which allows a
            language-neutral type declaration using "container", "nested", and "type". Even if the API call used to satisfy
            the service request returns nothing, <code class="clr-code">service_response</code> will return, at a minimum,
            an empty object.

<h3>Request Parameters</h3>
<p>
    A service request may, optionally require input parameters. These are categorized into two groups:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="clr-code">service_request_query_params</code> - Usually passed onto ReST API calls as query strings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="clr-code">service_request_param</code> - All other parameters, even without API calls.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Let's augment our previous specification for <strong class="emphasis">sddc-core</strong> in the above service.json,
    and add examples of input parameters. These are declared as arrays in either group and have similar format. The order
    of specificaion (sequence) is not important:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>
&#123;
    "name": "sddc-core",
    "version": "1",

    "service_requests": [
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetSddcList",
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc", "container": "array" &#125;
        &#125;,
        &#123;
            "service_request": "OperatorDeleteSddc",
            "service_request_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_param": "sddc" &#125;
            ],
            "service_request_query_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_query_param": "force", "optional": true &#125;
            ],
            "api": &#123; "uri": "/operator/sddcs/&#123;sddc&#125;", "api_method": "deleteSddcs" &#125;,
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Task" &#125;
        &#125;
    ]
&#125;
</code></pre>
<table class="table table-noborder flag-table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="left flag-header">Parameter Group</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">service_request_query_param</td>
        <td class="flag-value">
            In the above example, <code class="clr-code">force</code> is a query parameter. No type is
            specified, because query parameters are always strings, even if the API specifications declares it as something
            else (e.g. boolean or integer). Moreover, it is conventional to declare query parameters as
            <code class="clr-code">optional</code> even when the API specification states that the parameter is
            <code class="clr-code">required</code>. As with all specifications of <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code>,
            the absence of a type specification is interpretted as being of type <strong class="emphasis">string</strong>.
            <br/><br/>
            If the <code class="clr-code">optional</code> property is not specified, it is still possible to prevent this
            string from being passed to an API call by setting it to <code class="clr-code">null</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">service_request_param</td>
        <td class="flag-value">
            Path parameters, body parameters, and parameters local to a
            <code class="clr-code">customized</code> Service Adapter (described later), are all included in the array of
            <code class="clr-code">service_request_params</code>. The language-neutral type of the parameter is described
            using <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code>, i.e. using <strong class="emphasis">container</strong>,
            <strong class="emphasis">nested</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis">type</strong>.
            <br/><br/>
            In the above example, <code class="clr-code">sddc</code> is the UUID of an Sddc to be deleted. No other properties
            are specified, indicating the <code class="clr-code">sddc</code> is of type <strong class="emphasis">string</strong>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>API Calls</h2>
<p>In the above example Service Adapter Specification document, we have added
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>"api": &#123; "uri": "/operator/sddcs/&#123;sddc&#125;", "api_method": "deleteSddcs" &#125;
</code></pre>
<p>This says that the service request <strong class="emphasis">OperatorDeleteSddc</strong> needs to make an API call to
    a backend service in order to satisfy the request. The interface models ReST API calls, however, the same
    specifications may be used to specify API calls using other transports.
    The <code class="clr-code">api</code> property to the service request can have
    many additional properties defined. while there are several other properties described later,
    in the above example, only the following properties are specified:
</p>

<table class="table table-noborder flag-table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="left flag-header">API Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">uri</td>
        <td class="flag-value">
            This specifies the endpoint of the API call. In the above example specification, the ReST transport is being used,
            hence, the endpoint is an URI path: <code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>/operator/sddcs/&#123;sddc&#125;</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">api_method</td>
        <td class="flag-value">
            The above specification of an <code class="clr-code">uri</code> results in the generation of an API Class object
            in the respective language. This class contains all the methods (public class functions) that implement each of
            the operations that constitute the API calls.
            <br/><br/>
            Since we model API calls to be analogous to ReST calls (even if they are not), the supported methods are
            GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. If the names of these methods are not modifed by the use of extensions
            <code class="clr-code">x-vmw-vapi-methodname</code> and <code class="clr-code">x-vmw-appfabric-servicename</code>
            in the API Specification documents(s),
            then the default method names corresponding to the above will be <code class="clr-code">httpGet</code>,
            <code class="clr-code">httpPost</code>, <code class="clr-code">httpPut</code>,
            <code class="clr-code">httpPatch</code>, and <code class="clr-code">httpDelete</code>.
            <br/><br/>
            As noted above, the input parameters for this method are extracted from the <code class="clr-code">service_request_params</code>
            and <code class="clr-code">service_request_query_params</code> that were provided by the requestor to the service request.
        </td>

<h2>Event Handlers And Broadcasts</h2>
<p>
    All Service Adapters respond to requests over the bifr√∂st event bus. Additionally, some Service Adapters also listen
    to websocket events, and such Service Adapters are called <code class="clr-code">Event Handlers</code>. Most Event Handlers
    require <code class="clr-code">customized code</code> to be added to the Service Adapter beyond what is autogenerated, and
    is described in later chapters. The most important of these websocket events are
    <code class="clr-code">Task Update Events</code>, which is how asynchronous service requests are handled. These events
    notify of the progression of asynchronous handling of requests to backend services, as well as completions and failures.
</p>

<p>
    Just as a Service Adapter may listen for asynchronous websocket events, any Service Adapter may also emit its own
    events, called <code class="clr-code">Broadcasts</code> over the bifr√∂st event bus that applications may listen
    to asynchronously. A Service Adapter does not have to be an <strong class="emphasis">Event Handler</strong>
    in order to emit events via the <code class="clr-code">Broadcast</code> specification, however, as you will see below, a
    <code class="clr-code">Broadcast</code> specification is required if the Service Adapter is required to automatically
    generate code for updating <code class="clr-code">stores</code>.
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate the specification of <strong class="emphasis">Event Handlers</strong> and
    <strong class="emphasis">Broadcasts</strong>, let's augment our example specification from above:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>
&#123;
    "name": "sddc-core",
    "version": "1",

    "event_handler": true,
    "broadcast": &#123; "class":  "Sddc", "type": "SddcStateChangeType" &#125;,

    "service_requests": [
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetSddcList",
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc", "container": "array" &#125;
        &#125;,
        &#123;
            "service_request": "OperatorDeleteSddc",
            "service_request_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_param": "sddc" &#125;
            ],
            "service_request_query_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_query_param": "force", "optional": true &#125;
            ],
            "api": &#123; "uri": "/operator/sddcs/&#123;sddc&#125;", "api_method": "deleteSddcs" &#125;,
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Task" &#125;
        &#125;
    ]
&#125;
</code></pre>
<p>In the above augmented example, all we had to do was to set the boolean <code class="clr-code">event_handler</code> to
    <code class="clr-code">true</code>. That's it! <strong class="emphasis">ServGen</strong> takes care of
    autogenerating the Service Adapter with all the listeners and hooks, and all that is required is a small
    amount of customized logic to make it all work! We will cover that in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>
    The <code class="clr-code">broadcast</code> property above is how consumers know what to expect in broadcast payloads
    from the Service Adapter. While this property uses <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code> to specify
    the payload of the broadcast, which means using <code class="clr-code">container</code> and
    <code class="clr-code">nested</code>, <code class="clr-code">type</code> has been replaced by <code class="clr-code">class</code>.
    This is an unfortunate piece of legacy implementation that will be changed in the near future to be consistent with
    <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code>, and <code class="clr-code">class</code> will be replaced with <code class="clr-code">type</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, the <code class="clr-code">type</code> property specified above should be renamed to <code class="clr-code">change_type</code>
    as it is meant to provide a clue as to whether the broadcast is associated with a CUD event of the payload,
    i.e. <strong class="emphasis">Created</strong>, <strong class="emphasis">Updated</strong>, or
    <strong class="emphasis">Deleted</strong>. Note that the <code class="clr-code">type</code> property is optional,
    and its absence results in the autogeneration of an enumeration that contains values for these three kinds of notifications.
    The use of <code class="clr-code">type</code>, however, allows for customized enumeration of additional values that
    the Service Adapter developer may wish to provide as hints to consuming applications providing more flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    In the above example, <code class="clr-code">type</code> is specified to be <code class="clr-code">SddcStateChangeType</code>,
    which requires the developer to provide an enumeration with that name, that at a minimum, enumerates values for
    <code class="clr-code">Created</code>, <code class="clr-code">Updated</code>, and <code class="clr-code">Deleted</code>.
    The developer can now add additonal enumerations as shown in the excerpt below:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code class="language-typescript" ngNonBindable>
export enum SddcStateChangeType &#123;
    Created = 'SddcCreated',
    Updated = 'SddcUpdated',
    Deleted = 'SddcDeleted',
    SddcUpdated = 'SddcUpdated',
    SddcCreating = 'SddcCreating',
    SddcDeleting = 'SddcDeleting',
    SddcAddingHosts = 'SddcAddingHosts',
    SddcDeletingHosts = 'SddcDeletingHosts',
    :
    :
&#125;
</code></pre>

<p>
    If <code class="clr-code">type</code> had not been specified, <strong class="emphasis">ServGen</strong> would have
    autogenerated the above enumeration with values for <strong class="emphasis">Created</strong>,
    <strong class="emphasis">Updated</strong>, and
    <strong class="emphasis">Deleted</strong> only.
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Managing Stores Automatically</h2>

<p>
    <strong class="emphasis">ServGen</strong> allows for specifications that result in the creation of bifr√∂st stores,
    and adding, updating, and deleting items within it, triggered by responses to service requests automatically.
    To illustrate these capabilities, let us enhance our example Service Adapter Specification thus:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>
&#123;
    "name": "sddc-core",
    "version": "1",
    "event_handler": true,
    "broadcast": &#123; "class":  "Sddc", "type": "SddcStateChangeType" &#125;,

    "stores": [
        &#123;
            "store": "SddcStore",
            "store_id": "stores::vmc::sddc",
            "type": "Sddc"
        &#125;,
        &#123;
            "store": "ReservationStore",
            "store_id": "stores::vmc::reservation",
            "type": "ReservationWindow",
            "container": "array"
        &#125;
    ],

    "service_requests": [
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetUncachedSddcList",
            "api": &#123; "uri": "/orgs/&#123;org&#125;/sddcs", "api_method": "listSddcs" &#125;,
            "update_store": &#123; "update": "SddcStore", "property": "id" &#125;,
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc", "container": "array" &#125;
        &#125;,
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetUncachedSddc",
            "service_request_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_param": "sddc" &#125;
            ],
            "api": &#123; "uri": "/orgs/&#123;org&#125;/sddcs/&#123;sddc&#125;", "api_method": "getSddcs" &#125;,
            "update_store": &#123; "update": "SddcStore", "param": "sddc" &#125;,
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc" &#125;
        &#125;,
        &#123;
          "service_request": "GetAllTbrsReservations",
            "service_request_params": [
                &#123; "service_request_param": "sddcState", "type": "SddcStateRequest" &#125;
            ],
          "api": &#123; "uri": "/orgs/&#123;org&#125;/tbrs/reservation", "api_method": "postTbrs" &#125;,
          "service_response": &#123; "type": "ReservationWindow", "container": "map", "nested": "array" &#125;,
          "update_store": &#123; "update": "ReservationStore" &#125;
        &#125;
    ]
&#125;
</code></pre>

<p>
    Above, we have added a new property for the Service Adapter: <code class="clr-code">stores</code>, which is
    an array of one more bifr√∂st stores that will be created and owned by this Service adapter. Each such
    autogenerated <code class="clr-code">store</code> specifies a readable name for it, as well as a UUID
    specified usin <code class="clr-code">store_id</code>, and a <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code>
    which specifies the usual <code class="clr-code">container</code>, <code class="clr-code">nested</code>,
    and <code class="clr-code">type</code> for each element in the store. Conceptually, a bifr√∂st store is
    a <code class="clr-code">Map</code> of key/value pairs, where each <strong class="emphasis">value</strong>
    has a type that is specified by <code class="clr-code">CommonType</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Note: there must be one, and only one <code class="clr-code">broadcast</code> property specified,
    irrespective of how many stores are specified. Stores have their own notification mechanism using
    bifr√∂st, and <code class="clr-code">broadcast</code> is used for manual broadcasts on the broadcast
    channel for the Service Adapter.
</p>

<p>
    In the above example, two stores are specified: <code class="clr-code">SddcStore</code>, which contains elements
    which are of the type <code class="clr-code">Sddc</code> class, and <code class="clr-code">ReservationStore</code>,
    whose elements are arrays of type <code class="clr-code">ReservationWindow</code> class. On instantiation of the
    Service Adapter, these stores are created if they do not already exist.
</p>

<p>
    In the three service requests in the above example, <strong class="emphasis">GetUncachedSddcList</strong>,
    <strong class="emphasis">GetUncachedSddc</strong>, <strong class="emphasis">GetAllTbrsReservations</strong>,
    we have added a property <code class="clr-code">update_store</code>. Each of these <code class="clr-code">update_store</code>
    specifications contain additional specifiers, either <code class="clr-code">update</code>, or
    <code class="clr-code">delete</code>, as well as optional key retrieval qualifiers <code class="clr-code">property</code>,
    <code class="clr-code">param</code>, and the deprecated <code class="clr-code">uuid</code>. The actual operation on
    the respective stores is very dependent on the <code class="clr-code">service_response</code> from each service request.
</p>

<p>
    In the first of the service requests above, <strong class="emphasis">GetUncachedSddcList</strong> makes an API call
    to the backend service and returns an array of <strong class="emphasis">Sddc</strong> classes. The
    <code class="clr-code">update_store</code> specifies that the entirety of the store named <strong class="emphasis">SddcStore</strong>
    should be updated from the array of <strong class="emphasis">Sddc</strong> class, and the <code class="clr-code">key</code>
    to that store for each element of the array should be obtaining by the specified
    <code class="clr-code">property</code>: <strong class="emphasis">id</strong>. So, as we iterate through the array of Sddc classes,
    we would update the store with each of the Sddc classes, using each <code class="clr-code">Sddc.id</code> as the key to the
    store.
</p>

<p>
    The second service request above, <strong class="emphasis">GetUncachedSddc</strong> returns a single instance of an Sddc class by providing its
    UUID using the input parameter <code class="clr-code">sddc</code> which is a string with the requested UUID. Since the
    <code class="clr-code">service_response</code> is a single Sddc, the <code class="clr-code">update</code> property
    also specifies a qualifier <code class="clr-code">param</code>. This essentially says that we should scan the input
    parameters to the service request, looking for a parameter named <code class="clr-code">sddc</code>, and use its
    value as the key into <strong class="emphasis">SddcStore</strong> to update the Sddc there.
</p>

<p>
    The third and most complex service request above, <strong class="emphasis">GetAllTbrsReservations</strong> has a service response
    which is a map of an array of type ReservationWindow class. This is represented in Typescript as
    <code class="clr-code">Map&lt;string,Array&lt;ReservationWindow&gt;&gt;</code>. Moreover, the <code class="clr-code">update</code>
    property has neither the <code class="clr-code">property</code> nor <code class="clr-code">param</code> qualifier. In order to
    update the specified <code class="clr-code">ReservationStore</code>, <strong class="emphasis">Servgen</strong> infers that
    the <code class="clr-code">service_response</code> Map needs to update the store using the Map keys as store keys. Essentially,
    the store becomes a reflection of the response Map.
</p>

<p>
    We won't describe the <code class="clr-code">uuid</code> qualifier for <code class="clr-code">update</code> in detail because
    it is deprecated, but briefly, it is used to stuff the entirety of a <code class="clr-code">service_response</code>,
    into a single store element using the key specified by <code class="clr-code">uuid</code>. Code using this will continue
    to work for a while, but should be changed to use one of the methods described in the example specification.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    That's it! This is all you need to specify a complex Service Adapter! There are more things associated with Service
    Adapters that can be specified, each in its own specification document in subsequent chapters,
    but this is the most that is required to populate a <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> for any Service Adapter.
