<h1>Service Adapter Specification</h1>

<h3>Specifications: service.json</h3>

<p>
    By convention, <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> contains the core specification for a Service Adapter. There must exist
    one instance of this specification file (or its content) in order for a Service Adapter to be autogenerated. Consider the following
    minimalist <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> for the <strong class="emphasis">SddcCore</strong> Service Adapter, which
    responds to a single service request, and it does not result in any API calls to a backend service. Because of this lack of dependence
    on a backend service, this Service Adapter is also a <code class="clr-code">Service</code> itself.
    We will augment this specification incrementally to explain each additional property in detail:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code class="language-json" ngNonBindable>
&#123;
    "name": "sddc-core",
    "version": "1",

    "service_requests": [
        &#123;
            "service_request": "GetSddcList",
            "service_response": &#123; "type": "Sddc", "container": "array" &#125;
        &#125;
    ]
&#125;
</code></pre>
<table class="table table-noborder flag-table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="left flag-header">Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="left flag">name</td>
        <td class="flag-value">This property specifies that the name of the Service Adapter is <code class="clr-code">sddc-core</code>.
            The kebab-case for the name is usual for Service Adapters written in Typescript. For those written in Java, the name must
            be in PascalCase, i.e. <code class="clr-code">SddcCore</code>. In either language, the value for
            <strong class="emphasis">name</strong> specified here must match the name of the folder for the Service Adapter. Thus,
            for Typescript, the location of this <code class="clr-code">service.json</code> is
            <strong class="emphasis">.../sddc-core/specs/service.json</strong>, while for Java, it is
            <strong class="emphasis">.../SddcCore/specs/service.json</strong>. In either language, the class autogenerated for
            this Service Adapter will be <strong class="emphasis">SddcCoreService</strong> (to be renamed to
            <strong class="emphasis">SddcCoreServiceAdapter</strong> in future).
